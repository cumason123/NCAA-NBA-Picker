# NCAA Dataset Analysis

This is project born in the Google Cloud & NCAA hackathon on the week of Jan 26, 2019 at MIT. It won first place.

Our project includes the following components:
1. An ensemble classifier that predicts if NBA applicants would be successfully drafted by NBA teams based on their historial performance and personal background (school, team, etc.) See [classifiers.py](https://github.com/cumason123/NCAA-NBA-Picker/blob/master/classifiers.py) for classifiers. See [tree.png](https://github.com/cumason123/NCAA-NBA-Picker/blob/master/tree.png) for the visualization of the importance of features (based on one tree from the random forest).
2. An LSTM model to predict outcomes of future games. See  [Game_Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/cumason123/NCAA-NBA-Picker/blob/master/Game_Prediction.ipynb "Game Prediction").

Note:
1. Since we only have a limited small-sized dataset, the results here are not fully realistic.
